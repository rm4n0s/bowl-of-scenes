The software will help organize prompts, LoRAs and poses in groups for only one goal, to combine them to create images in bulk.

For example, lets say you want to create assets for a game like DOOM 2. On this example you want to create a monster that walks and looking angry in every frame of the walk. To do all that you will have only to call " anime_workflow x monsters(skeleton) x emotions(angry) x walking_for_all_rotations" based on the organized groups of monsters, emotions and walking.
This will call the ComfyUI server and create all the images in this format (or similar) anime_skeleton_angry_walking_rotation_45_frame_2.jpg in a folder.
